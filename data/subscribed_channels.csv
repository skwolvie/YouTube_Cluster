2) I worked for NASA JPL for 9 years, 7 of which were working on the Curiosity Rover (I made a video about it you should def totes watch cause it's probably my favorite of all my videos).  Then I created Digital Dudz (made some videos about this too) and eventually sold it after 2 years.  Then I worked for Apple in their Special Projects Group doing Product Design as a Mechanical Engineer for 5 years.  As of 2019, I just make my monthly YouTube videos.

At the 2006 World Economic Forum, Crown Prince Haakon of Norway and other Young Global Leaders sought to understand the cause of our increasingly polarized world. Their conclusion: a fundamental lack of dignity and recognition of our shared humanity.

Determined to unite everyone with the belief that we all deserve to live a life of dignity, they launched Global Dignity with a workshop in one small classroom in Switzerland. 

The organization has since grown to a 80-nation-strong network of volunteer educators, civil and business leaders, and advocates working to strengthen dignity-based values among young people in their communities. Through its annual Global Dignity Day in October, and now in year-round Dignity Workshops, Global Dignity has reached over 3 million young people since its founding.",UCI7-iazJE_CiuVw7_yEpinA

AKUO - SECOND CHANNEL,"HOW SUBLIMINALS WORK: The subconscious mind is the part of our mind that records everything we experience, it holds our habits and beliefs that are programmed into us at an early age. The subconscious is programmed when we are kids, and then as we get older our conscious mind serves as a buffer to prevent things from constantly changing. This is why its so hard to change bad habits with conscious decisions to do so. The subconscious controls everything from our heartbeat, digestion, DNA, cell growth,  bone growth, hair growth and much more. These are all things that happen without us commanding our body to do so. 

There are affirmations playing underneath the music so that your conscious mind cannot reject them. Once they bypass the conscious buffer they go right into the subconscious where they are acted on. With this method, we are essentially giving commands to the intelligence that unconsciously controls our body and our cells. This is how people are getting physical changes.",UCqTU2-sZlJZppgwb_Z5LXhQ

No BS polarization or political angle‚Äîjust pure authentic interactions with the locals. 

I present the story. You present your own opinion.

We'll learn about the rapid changes in Saudi Arabia through a local woman‚Äôs perspective, journey into Hasidic Jewish communities in NYC, and go cruising with the Chicanos in LA. 

The goal is to get into someone else‚Äôs world to understand them and ourselves better. 

The ingredients are: a GoPro, simple editing, curiosity, a search for truth, and most importantly, authentic human interactions.

I‚Äôve lived abroad in four countries and traveled to 85. I've taken this perspective back to the USA to show Americans and the world what this great nation is like away from the mainstream media.",UC3Vuq4Q1bKFtAiKYlwRv3oA

Vortex Success,"The Vortex Success channel was created out of goodwill to help you shift your subconscious limiting beliefs and achieve your goals.  My channel provides you with high-quality, audio subliminal messages (and a few visual sessions).

I record the subliminal messages using my own voice.

Many of the subliminal meditations are combined with Brainwave Entrainment such as Binaural Beats and Isochronic Tones.  

Listen up to an hour per day/night to recordings with Brainwave entrainment.  Do not listen if you are under 18.

‚ÄúIf you want to do something big in life, all you need is Josh‚Äù
With this thought an idea was born, to share and celebrate the most incredible stories of Bharat and ignite power inside each one of us. 
Josh Talks is this thought. 

Josh Talks is a platform where we share beautiful stories of role models; of people who come into our lives in the form of an elder brother and sister- sometimes as stories that show us the bright side of the world, sometimes as faces that we love and look up to and sometimes as skills that bring the better of us. 

So let‚Äôs fill ourselves with Josh and keep moving forward in our lives.
If you know of someone who has attained success because of their hard work and determination and are role models for people, share their stories on speaker@joshtalks.com

We are a group of dedicated shooters and responsible gun owners interested in advancing firearm and shooting culture across our own country of Slovenia and across the World.
Our biggest passion is filming entertaining and educational videos which we upload to our YouTube channel.

Despite some of our less serious videos we are also passionate about advocating safe, responsible gun ownership, are sceptical of governmental gun control laws that limit access to individuals who wish to pursue the sport of shooting and/or require firearms for their personal protection.  
We also strongly believe in personal freedom, responsibility and duty to ourselves and to others in our community who require our help.",UC-24483CtyVfhJ-XxRfPr8Q

De talenten die de drie coaches kippenvel kunnen bezorgen, nemen het tegen elkaar op in de Battles, waarna slechts zes van hen doorstoten naar de grote finale.

Igor Presnyakov,"Born in Moscow, Russia, Igor Presnyakov studied classical music at a nearby academy and would eventually graduate as both a guitarist and a conductor for ensembles. He relocated to the Netherlands to further his career, which has now spanned over 35 years. His unique acoustic guitar-style is influenced by various musical genres from Reggae, Rock and Roll, R&B, Country-western, Jazz and Heavy Metal. His most noticeable attribute is his creative style of ""beating"" the percussion of the song, onto the body of his acoustic guitar while playing. This replicates the sound of multiple musicians, while only Igor is playing. Igor also rarely sings any of the lyrics to any kind of song that he covers, and instead skillfully translates them into a guitar melody, having his instrument sing the words.

Chai Town,"Ten years ago, a group of young men took their musical talents to Champaign with an idea...to create a new flavor of a cappella that would excite the taste of peoples' ear drums. That vision led to the creation of Chai-Town. Though it is considered a band, Chai-Town is a brotherhood of musicians that entertain their fans as they follow their love of music.

For the past decade they have brewed cups of music that were ""Good to the Last Drop"" and have left their fans saying ""Aaaah...Arohanam""; Yet, overtime, the scent from this Champaign brew emanated throughout the nation as people began to crave the taste of South Asian a cappella. From California to the Big Apple, audiences have tasted their famous blend of contemporary music with a hint of flavors from the homeland.

Each generation of Chai-Town has always produced a blend for your ear drums to digest so look for the scent of their brew at a campus near you!",UCgKDxZqafO2ND2EvW0ud9-g

Skrillex,"In a cluttered home studio in downtown Los Angeles‚Äô Arts District, mere blocks from where he wrote ‚ÄúScary Monsters & Nice Sprites‚Äù, the song that sold millions of copies and helped instigate one of the largest shifts in modern American music in recent memory, the galvanizing totem of a youth movement daps at a midi controller, ceaselessly cuing the same snare sound over and over for literally hours. 

Despite being one of the biggest names in music, Skrillex hasn‚Äôt walked away from the ‚Äòdo-it-ourselves‚Äô attitude he‚Äôs had since his start. ""It's all about making true partnerships. I think the less you can take out of something and the more you can do yourself, it's more equal-interest. So you're not taking out big bank loans, you're betting on yourself and you can sustain everything.

Guitar Goddess,"Hey! I'm Michelle and I go by the persona ‚ÄúGuitar Goddess.‚Äù Easier to remember, right? I teach beginner/intermediate guitar lessons here on YouTube because I have a passion for both music and for helping people. My goal is to inspire & motivate people like YOU all over the world to reach their guitar goals and push through the struggles without giving up.

To me Guitar Goddess does NOT mean ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the best guitarist out there.‚Äù The meaning of Guitar Goddess is on a much deeper and interconnected level. Guitar Goddess is that indescribable feeling I get whenever I play my guitar. I feel beautiful, confident & positive. It's unlike anything else. I feel like it's something other guitarists can relate to. Guitar Goddess does not define my skills or my playing style and I don't think the name I chose is un-deserving in any way.

John Crestani,"Growing up I was always a voracious learner with a penchant for travel. When I was in college I grew frustrated with the lack of real-world applications for the knowledge I was learning, and I was feeling anxious about becoming successful in the extremely expensive city of Los Angeles where I grew up.

I worked a corporate job at a marketing agency for two years before realizing that I would never reach my life or financial goals working for someone else. In 2012 I started my own business, with the goals of living a low-stress life, make millions per year, and travel the world. Since 2014, I have been able to achieve all these goals, consistently earning over 7-figures per year, and without having a single employee.

Now I live in Malibu with my wife and two daughters, and enjoy flying helicopters, kite-surfing, camping, and reading books.

On my channel I teach affiliate marketing, and feature vlogs where I try to help others get to that next level in career and life.",UCP1WWozNcnnBX73ZoMSem5w

"Bruce H. Lipton, Ph.D.","What would your life be like if you learned that you are more powerful than you have ever been taught?

Groundbreaking scientific studies find that genes can be turned on and off by environmental signals
including thoughts, feelings and emotions from outside the cell. Cellular biologist Dr. Bruce Lipton, a
former medical school professor and research scientist, was one of the first scientists to posit such
extra-cellular control. Dr. Lipton conducted a series of experiments that reveal that the cell membrane,
the outer layer of a cell, is the organic equivalent of a computer chip, and the cell‚Äôs equivalent of a
brain. Although this view conflicts with the widely held scientific dogma that genes control behavior,
papers by other researchers have validated his iconoclastic thinking.
